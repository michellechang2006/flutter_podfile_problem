# flutter_podfile_problem

## [Flutter Dev Issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/137052) 
### Is there an existing issue for this?

- [X] I have searched the [existing issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues)
- [X] I have read the [guide to filing a bug](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/bug-reports)

### Steps to reproduce

Hi, I've been learning Flutter dev recently.  I can't run the `pod install`, so I can't launch the application on the iPhone 15 simulator (if I install the pub package)

I'm sure that there's a `Podfile' in the project(iOS folder) directory.


<details>
<summary>`Podfile' file</summary>

```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '11.0'

target 'Runner' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for Runner

  target 'RunnerTests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
    # Pods for testing
  end

end
```

### Actual results

 I can't launch the application on the iPhone 15 simulator (if I add the pub package).
